            <h3> Who is Jerry? </h3>
            <p> 
                Hey, I am Jerry and I am a freelance artist. I love music, from classical to modern rap, and 
                I have been practicing piano and guitar for as long as I can remember, but 
                only recently have I realized how much of an impact it can have on people and on myself.

                You see, being an artist is a bit like being a writer. You have to find your voice, 
                make things that matter to you, and then share them with the world. 
                There is no one-size-fits-all approach to art; there is just YOU!
                
                And by sharing your work, you are helping other people find out what they want out of their lives, too.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I love music because it lets me share my deepest thoughts and ideas with others in a way that connects us all in a way no one else can do. 
                It iss like making connections with strangers—but more personal! 
            </p>
